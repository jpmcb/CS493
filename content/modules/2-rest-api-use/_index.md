## Introduction
<!--- Introduce the topic in this section -->
This module is going to discuss the concept of APIs and more specifically, RESTful APIs. An API is an Application Programming Interface. No one calls them that. If you do you will sound silly. It is basically the way for a programmer to access the functionality of a piece of software, library or hardware. REST is a particular style of making an API to make things a bit more standard on the web.

## Key Questions
<!--- List  key questions
- Key question 1
- Key question 2
    - Key question 2a
    - Key question 2b
 -->
 - What is an API and what is it used for?
 - What are the requirements for an API to be RESTful?
 - What is the relationship between REST APIs and the HTTP verbs?
 - How does one interact with an existing REST API?



## Assignment Overview
<!--- Give a general overview of the sort of assignment(s) students will do during the week -->
This week you will work with an existing REST API. This will help you get familiar with what a well implemented API looks like and what sort of interactions you can expect from the API.

## Explore the Topics
<!--- An automatically generated list of explore topics from the same directory as this overview. Generated from the frontmatter, make sure to fill in the title, description and include "Exploration" in the categories! -->

## Additional Resources
[Postman Documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/)
: This is a link to the Postman documentation. You should be able to get a good sense of how it works in the API demo, but if you want to get a more detailed explanation of tests and scripting options this is a great reference to use.

[Box API](https://developer.box.com/)
: This is the developer page for the Box API which is used in this weeks demo. If you want to use it you will need to sign up for a personal account as there is automatically one generated that is tied to your OSU email and it will not allow API access. Pay particular attention to the API reference which does a good job providing example API calls along with giving a good description of the routes available in the API.

## Review
This week should give you a pretty good overview of what REST is all about. You  may not yet be ready to make your own API, but hopefully you can start interacting with existing APIs like Box or GitHub, both of which are pretty well designed REST implementations. After you have spent some time interacting with them you should better understand *why* we set things up this way which should prepare you to make your own decisions when creating an API yourself.
