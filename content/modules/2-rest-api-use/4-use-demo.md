<!--- The weight above determines what order this will be shown among other exploration topics in this same folder, lower numbers are shown first. Start using at least multiples of 5, that way if you need to add a content page between existing ones there are enough open weights to do so. They are integers only -->

## Introduction
<!--- Introduce the content of this exploration -->
We are going to walk through using a real live API to see what it practically looks like to do these sorts of tasks. This video uses the [Box API reference](https://developer.box.com/v2.0/reference) as a guide when it comes to setting up the calls. This API is well documented and shows examples for every call. The [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) API tool is used to interact with the API via a somewhat graphical interface. The [Postman documentation](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/) is pretty complete. Pay particular attention to the portion on scripting. It will help you with writing your own test scripts.

If you want to with this API and follow along with the video you will need to make a personal Box account and register as a developer at the [Box developer](https://developer.box.com/) page. From there you can access a developer access token that works for an hour at a time and is quite simple to use as seen in the below video.

## Review
<!--- Encourage students to reflect on what they should have learned from this exploration. -->
This should have given you an idea of what one can expect when working with a REST API. Generally things are going to work in much the same way here as they do in other REST APIs, that is really the whole point of them. If you understand the concept of working with resources, that can be easily applied elsewhere. Likely the most challenging thing you will run into when working with APIs is authentication. If you post to the forums other students and the instructor can help you work through those sorts of problems as they can be a bit tricky at first.
